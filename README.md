Try to escape the zombies! 

HTML/JavaScript game I coded in 2015 and greatly improved in 2025. 

You control a character and must help him escape the zombies roaming around.
If one of the zombies touches you, it's over.
You can use the on-screen buttons or the arrow keys to move around.
There are 3 zombies by default, but you can increase that number if you feel brave enough.
The game world is divided in 9 parts, the 3 parts on top are the beach, the 3 parts in the middle are the forest, and the 3 parts at the bottom are the sea.
